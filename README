miarl
-- THE pure POSIX sh roguelike; better known as the "mia roguelike"
---
status
-- the mia roguelike is currently extremely WIP as literally all the background work is being done by hand
-- from the ground up; since as far as ik, literally no one in their right mind would attempt this
-- the current process is a bit slow; since I tend to have burn out /a lot/
-- but I promise work on the mia roguelike should start no later than 2024 (?) 
-- until than; see below for the various ideas I have for this project
---
ideas
-- per room generation seeds
-- loot generation seeds created on the fly
-- user controllable seeds
-- bash addons
-- easy modding
-- completely editable via raw source
-- completely sandboxed setup contained in ./
-- large refractoring with easy lib managment via submods
---
Caveats
-- pure POSIX sh is extremely limited comparred to pure bash
-- and without POSIX alternatives to things like `read -N 1`
-- user interaction must be done using the raw cli
---
Info
-- this project will depend on outside (still pure sh) libraries
-- cloning the repo/project for usage requires one to use `--recursive` to pull in the submods
