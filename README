# miarl
-- THE pure POSIX sh roguelike; better known as the "mia roguelike"
----
# Caveats
-- pure POSIX sh is extremely limited comparred to pure bash
-- and without POSIX alternatives to things like `read -N 1`
-- user interaction must be done using the raw cli
# Info
-- this project depends on outside (still pure sh) libraries
-- cloning the repo/project for usage requires one to use `--recursive` to pull in the submods
